## Project 2: Landing Page

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to manipulate the DOM using Javascript. I was provided with starter code in the form of an HTML template as well as CSS styling. Using this template, I was tasked with using various Javascript techniques to achieve the following:

- Dynamically add a navigation bar to the page
- Prevent default action for anchor tags in the nav
- When a given link in the nav is clicked, jump to the respective point on the page
- When the given section is brought into the viewpoint, add active class styling
- Hide the navbar when scrolling up, show it when scrolling down. 
- Display active class on the nav bar for the link clicked or when the respective section is in focus
